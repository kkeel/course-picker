","Recommended for learners who have completed Physical Science, such as Alveary Grade 7-8 Science, including the laboratory activities. Learners should be taking at least Algebra I alongside Chemistry. Teachers wishing to place students in Physical Science instead of Chemistry may choose either to complete Alveary Grade 7-8 Science in a single year (with 5 lessons + 1 lab each week available in the Grade 7-8 lesson plans) or to purchase separately from Classical Academic Press the Novare Introductory Physics Program and Video Course.
