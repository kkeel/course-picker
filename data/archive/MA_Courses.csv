These foundational approaches are seamlessly adapted to teach school-age children a second language.

The lessons are designed to be open-and-go with optional video/audio file support. They do not require any background in the target language for the parent/teacher or students. They only take about 15-20 min a day and can be easily adjusted to meet a variety of grade ranges from 1st to 6th grades.
","Three lessons each week are shared between Grades 1-6, but students in Grades 4-6 add two additional extension day lessons. This course is on a six-year rotation of lessons, so it is suitable for students who took Lower Spanish last year or students just starting their studies.

Students in grade 4+ who feel anxious about speaking a new language may benefit from taking a year without the added extension days. This approach allows them to build confidence and comfort before focusing on speaking and writing.
