➜ RATIONALE: Tuk and the Whale is a work of historical fiction, which imagines a seventeenth-century encounter between the Inuit of Baffin Island and a beleaguered European whaling ship that strayed from its expected route. Wary of each other, unable to communicate, yet united in a common purpose - the whale hunt - these two groups interacted for the first time to form a tentative partnership and begin to learn from each other. Since the story is told from the perspective of Tuk, a young Inuit boy, it is engaging for young readers, and it presents a vivid depiction of a way of life that has now largely vanished.

➜ RATIONALE: It is important to see history from different perspectives. Not only does it give us a more accurate understanding of the past, but it also helps us to learn the stories of other people who are fellow image-bearers. This book tells about the life and culture of the Wampanoag before colonists arrived in America. It also tells how their lives changed as a result of the new colonists. This book sets the Natives' story in context by presenting the ideas and worldviews that led to the demise of the natives' way of life. Although these ideas and questions can be hard to face, we believe these discussions are part of a Mason education as students learn the value of different points of view and gain an understanding of the complexity of history.","Term 2

Washington's accomplishments and sense of hope are inspiring, and his founding of the Tuskegee Institute which continues as a historically black university and National Historic Site today is a remarkable achievement, even taking into consideration the later unethical research problems that have come to light in more recent years.

Not only does it give us a more accurate understanding of the past, but it also helps us to learn the stories of other people who are fellow image-bearers. This book tells about the life and culture of the Wampanoag before colonists arrived in America. It also tells how their lives changed as a result of the new colonists. This book sets the Natives' story in context by presenting the ideas and worldviews that led to the demise of the natives' way of life.

Pascal & Fermat by Robert Black
ISBN/ASIN 978-0898247060 

➜ RATIONALE: In the early 1650s, a French aristocrat posed a gambling question to Blaise Pascal, one of the most brilliant scientists and philosophers of the time. But even Pascal needed help. The idea of seeing the future—even seeing a possible future—was so alien that he needed to discuss it with someone else. So he contacted his countryman Pierre de Fermat, arguably the greatest “amateur” mathematician of all time. Over several months, the two men exchanged a series of letters that laid the foundation of what we know today as probability theory. 
There’s a “Doing the Math” section at the end of the book so that students can try working out the math themselves! This is a shorter read than some of the other options for Term 3.

➜ RATIONALE: Capturing the drama of the race to decode this key to the ancient past, John Ray traces the paths pursued by the British polymath Thomas Young and Jean-Francois Champollion, the ""father of Egyptology"" ultimately credited with deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. He shows how Champollion ""broke the code"" and explains more generally how such deciphering is done, as well as its critical role in the history of Egyptology. Concluding with a chapter on the political and cultural controversy surrounding the Stone, the book also includes an appendix with a full translation of the Stone's text.

➜ RATIONALE: In this engaging book, Greg Koabel challenges the notion that pre-Confederation Canada unfolded in a linear fashion, and instead suggests that nation-building involved greater ""regional, national, and human diversity"" than is typically acknowledged.  To illustrate this argument, Koabel introduces his readers to twenty episodes significant to Canada's history, but whose major players have been largely forgotten. These biographical vignettes give readers a more personal - and memorable - connection to Canadian history.

➜ RATIONALE: A work of creative non-fiction that is both personal and expansive in its scope, Acadian Driftwood recounts the Acadian Expulsion of 1755 through the experiences of the Leblanc family, which included ten siblings and their parents. The author is a descendant of this family, and only discovered his Acadian ancestry once he began to do genealogical research as an adult. This book makes an excellent history spine as it weaves the diverse fates of the family members into the larger conflicts, events, and developments of the latter-half of the eighteenth century.
