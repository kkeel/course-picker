These are hand-stitching techniques that incorporate different stitches to create beautiful patterns. For the 3rd term, students will learn the art of cloisonné, which regained popularity in the West during that time. Cloisonne is an enameling technique that uses metal strips to create delicate designs.\n",

These foundational approaches are seamlessly adapted to teach school-age children a second language.\n\nThe lessons are designed to be open-and-go with optional video/audio file support. They do not require any background in the target language for the parent/teacher or students. They only take about 15-20 min a day and can be easily adjusted to meet a variety of grade ranges from 1st to 6th grades.\n",

This course is on a six-year rotation of lessons, so it is suitable for students who took Lower Spanish last year or students just starting their studies.\n\nStudents in grade 4+ who feel anxious about speaking a new language may benefit from taking a year without the added extension days. This approach allows them to build confidence and comfort before focusing on speaking and writing.\n",
