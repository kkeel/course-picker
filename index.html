    <!-- Core Subjects -->
    <section class="section" id="core">
      <div class="section-grid">
        <div>
          <div class="kicker">Step 1</div>
          <h2>Core Subjects</h2>
          <div class="bar dark"></div>

          <p>
            Start by focusing on the core subjects required by your state or those you consider nonnegotiable,
            such as Bible, History, Geography, English/Reading, Literature, Science, and Math.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you plan to modify a subject—such as focusing on only one stream of History (e.g., World, Ancient,
            or US/Canadian for grades 4+)—make a note of it. Similarly, if you intend to combine students into a
            single grade level for a subject (e.g., 2nd and 3rd graders sharing a 3rd-grade Science course), make
            note of that too.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
            Refer to our tips on <a href="combine.html">combining students</a> for additional guidance.
            <!-- Swap combine.html to the real route when you have it -->
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="side-img">

    <!-- High Interest Subjects -->
    <section class="section" id="high-interest">
      <div class="section-grid">
        <div>
          <div class="kicker">Step 2</div>
          <h2>High Interest Subjects</h2>
          <div class="bar"></div>

          <p>
            Next, choose a few subjects that spark high interest for each child or that your whole family would
            enjoy together.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can focus on the same subject throughout the year or rotate topics to explore a variety. For example,
            you might dedicate one term each to Shakespeare, Plutarch, and Composer Study if you don’t have room for a
            full year of each. If you prefer a slower pace, consider spreading a term’s worth of lessons across two terms.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
            This approach works well for subjects such as Art Instruction or Singing, giving you the flexibility
            to adjust to your students’ needs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="side-img">

    <!-- Additional Subjects -->
    <section class="section" id="additional">
      <div class="section-grid">
        <div>
          <div class="kicker">Step 3</div>
          <h2>Additional Subjects</h2>
          <div class="bar"></div>

          <p>
            Review the remaining subjects and choose one or two that feel especially important to include,
            especially if they haven’t been covered yet. Consider options that:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Fulfill high school credit requirements.</li>
            <li>Reflect your family’s priorities or interests.</li>
            <li>Align with your child’s passions or future goals.</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin:10px 0 0;">
            These could also be subjects where Alveary offers resources without daily lesson plans
            (e.g., cooking or car maintenance) or areas where you can incorporate non-Alveary resources,
            such as co-op classes or ACT prep courses.

          <p>
            Now that you’ve identified your subjects you are ready to create a schedule using Alveary’s scheduling tools.
            This is a great starting point for your school year.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have room for additional subjects—or think you might later—make a list of what you’d like to include
            and why each is important. Consider adding these subjects when time allows.
